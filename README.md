## Description

yard-parameters is a plugin for YARD for parsing
[parameters](http://parameters.rubyforge.org).

## Features

* Parses `parameter :name` class method-calls.

## Requirements

* [yard](http://yardoc.org/) >= 0.4.0

## Install

    $ sudo gem install yard-parameters

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
